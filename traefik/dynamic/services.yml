# Traefik Dynamic Service Configuration
# This file defines backend services
#
# Service Configuration:
#   - Maps router rules to actual backend services
#   - Load balancer configuration for high availability
#   - Services are referenced by Docker service names
#   - Ports match the exposed ports in docker-compose.yml
#
# Note: Deployed app services are automatically discovered via Docker labels
# and don't need to be configured here.
